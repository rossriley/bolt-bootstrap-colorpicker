Bootstrap colorpicker
======================

A replacement for the colorpicker extension that no longer seems to work. Based on http://mjolnic.com/bootstrap-colorpicker/ and Raistlfiren/FAIconFieldType

	color:
  		type: bootstrapcolorpicker

Supported options:

	color:
  	    type: bootstrapcolorpicker
  	    format: inline
 	    hidden: true
            horizontal: true
            inline: true
            align: right
            component: true

Extension icon (color wheel) by Aha-Soft from the Noun Project. Color added (badly) to the icon by me.
